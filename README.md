ISO BAR Code test using create-react-app

I've used the create-react-app since it creates the skeleton app, preconfigured with linting, transpiling, hot reloading and unit testing built in. To get going quickly. I decided to use the typescript template so I can make the application more readable and robust.

I install redux to use to store and minipulate the data.

I use Jest to run the tests and react-testing-library functionalities to test the components
